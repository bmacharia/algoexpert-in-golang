 ## Validate Subsequence

https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/ 

Description 


 Given two non-empty arrays of integers, write a function that determines whether the second array is a subsequence of the first one.

A subsequence of an array is a set of numbers that are not necessarily a adjacent in the array, but that are in the same order as they appear in the array. For instance the numbers ``[1, 3, 4]`` form is subsequence of the array ``[1, 2, 3, 4]``, and so do the numbers to ``[2,4]``. Note that a single number in an array and array itself are both valid subsequences of the array
