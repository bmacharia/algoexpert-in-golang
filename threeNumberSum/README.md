## Three Number Sum

https://www.algoexpert.io/questions/three-number-sum

Write a function that takes in a non empty array of distinct integers in the antigen presenting a Target song. The function should find all triplets in the array that sum up to the target sum and return a return two dimensional array of all these triplets. The numbers in each triplet should be in ascending order, and the triplets in themselves should be ordered in ascending order with respect to numbers they hold.

If no three numbers sum up to the Target the function should return an empty array
