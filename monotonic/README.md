## Monotonic Array

https://www.algoexpert.io/questions/monotonic-array

Write a function that takes in an array of integers and returns a boolean representing whether the array is monotonic.

An array is said to be monotonic if its elements, from left to right, are entirely non-increasing(trending upwards), or entirely non-decreasing(trending downwards).

Non-increasing elements are not necessarily exclusively decreasing; they just do not increase. Similarly, non-decreasing elements are not necessarily exclusively increasing; they do not decrease.

Note that empty arrays and arrays that consist of only one element are monotonic.

Sample Input

```
array = [-1,-5,-10-1100,-1100,-1101,-9001]

```

Sample Output

```
True
```
