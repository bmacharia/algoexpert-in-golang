# 1. Two Number Sum

https://www.algoexpert.io/questions/two-number-sum

# Description

Write a function that takes in an non-empty array of distinct integers and an integer representing a target sum. If any two numbers in the input array sum up to the Target sum, the function should return them in an array, in any order. If no 2 numbers some up to the target sum, the function should return an empty array

Note that the target sum has to be obtained by summing two different integerw in the array, you can not add a single integer to itself in order to obtain the target song

 You can assume that there will be at most one pair of numbers summing up to the target sum.


Example:
```
Given nums = [3, 5, -4, 8, 11, 1, -1, 6], target = 10,

Because nums[4] + nums[6] = 11 + (-1) = 10,
return [11, -1].
