The given coins can have any positive integer value and the values are not unique. You can have multiple coins of the same value.

For Example, if you are giving `coins = [1, 2, 5]` the minimum amount of change you cannot create is `4`. If you are giving no coins, the minimum amount of change that you cannot create this one
